## GoNote - Terminal client for SimpleNote

GoNote is a simple utility for managing notes in your SimpleNote account. It allows basic operations like creating new notes - either by using external editor, piping file contents or just passing text in command line, aswell as listing, editing and deleting them. I'm probably one of many developers who use terminal on a daily basis and, in time leaving it just to save some text for later became a nuisance. At the same time I like having all my notes available on my phone or in the browser, just in case I don't have my computer with me. SimpleNote is a service which focuses on having very straightforward and transparent way of managing your notes, at the same allowing access to your account from mobile devices and web - thus the reason for choosing it as a storage backend for this utility.
